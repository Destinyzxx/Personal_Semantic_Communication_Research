The contents in this directory are related to simulation code and result of semantic communication for image transmission. Every folder in this directory corresponds to a paper of semantic communication, whose name is the title of paper. I will provide citations for these papers in the README.md file under each folder.
&nbsp;

It should be noted that for the sake of project standardization, every folder share the same architecture:
```
title of paper
|-->checkpoint
|-->config
|-->|-->config_class.py
|-->dataset
|-->|-->dataset_load.py
|-->model
|-->train.py
|-->test.py
```
